As a restaurant employee, I want to be able to easily update inventory in a fast and timely matter so I can update inventory quickly on busy days. <br><br>

Elaboration: Users should have the ability to easily update information without having to focus on pressing too many buttons or navigating too many windows to update or add one item. To do this, we will have ease of access by having two major buttons at the top of the chart stating whether information will need to be created or deleted. Users will also be able to update inventory table simply by clicking on the respective box they want to update and typing. <br><br>

Constraints: none <br><br>

Effort Estimation: 4 hours <br><br>

Acceptance Test: We will test each button is working correctly by pretending to be a worker ourselves and simulating adding inventory products, updating current inventory and deleting inventory that is no longer needed. <br><br><br>
