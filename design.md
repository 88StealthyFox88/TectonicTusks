Architecture Diagram: 

![Architecture Model](/assets/ArchDiagram.png) 
  - Our Architecture Style is a Repository Style. We will have our main GUI that the user interacts with, and based on the button clicked and information entered, data will be updated, created, or deleted from a database. The database is our central repository of information which the whole python GUI revolves around. <br>
  The diagram above also shows a separate table that holds information about past days inventory counts that the user has to manually click a button to save into. The user is then able to retrieve that saved data for reference and comparison.
