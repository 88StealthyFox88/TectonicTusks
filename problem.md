<strong>General Purpose/Description</strong> <br/><br/>
The general purpose of this project is to create a desktop application that will aid in the process of keeping track of food/inventory in a restaurant. This will include an interface that allows you to see how much food you have on-hand, how much food you have actually used vs. how much you should have used, when product is taken in and expires, and an interface that allows modifications and new food orders.

<strong>Inventory Description</strong>  <br/><br/>
For the inventory management portion of the project, this will include an interface that will list each item and how much of each the restaurant has. In terms of how this interface looks, the general idea is a simple table that will have the name of one item and how much of that product the restaurant has on-hand in each row along with the items expiration dates. Something along the lines of:  


| Product | Amount | Unit | Expiration |
| ------- | ------ | ---- | ---------- |
| Lettuce | 30     | lbs  | 04/01/2022 |

<strong>Customer Interface</strong> <br/><br/>
The customer interface will allow people to place their food orders. The interface will appear to be an ordering screen to the customer, but in the background will update current inventory, track sales, and deliver the food order to the restaurant. This should allow for real time tracking of inventory and sales which would be given to our database to keep up to date information. This interface could be strickly image based, or standard text menu. Not yet decided.

<strong>System and Program Operations</strong> <br/><br/>
This product will be designed to primarily operate off of windows systems. Python will be the main language we use to program both our customer and database interfaces. 

<strong>Context of Product</strong><br/><br/>
This product would be used in smaller restaurants that are looking for a small scale inventory system. Food trucks, local restaurants, or vendors. This system is not intended for large scale use. Target user would be someone looking for a simple tracking system for inventory that is not overly complex to use or expensive.
