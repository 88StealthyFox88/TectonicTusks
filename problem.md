General Purpose/Description
The general purpose of this project is to create a desktop application that will aid in the process of keeping track of food/inventory in a restaurant. This will include an interface that allows you to see how much food you have on-hand, how much food you have actually used vs. how much you should have used, and an interface that allows modifications and new food orders.

Inventory Description
For the inventory management portion of the project, this will include an interface that will list each item and how much of each the restaurant has. In terms of how this interface looks, the generally idea is a simple table that will have the name of one item and how much of that product the restaurant has on-hand in each row. Something along the lines of:
Product	Amount	Unit
