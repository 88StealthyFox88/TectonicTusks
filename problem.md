<strong>General Purpose/Description</strong> <br />
The general purpose of this project is to create a desktop application that will aid in the process of keeping track of food/inventory in a restaurant. This will include an interface that allows you to see how much food you have on-hand, how much food you have actually used vs. how much you should have used, and an interface that allows modifications and new food orders.

<strong>Inventory Description</strong>  <br />
For the inventory management portion of the project, this will include an interface that will list each item and how much of each the restaurant has. In terms of how this interface looks, the generally idea is a simple table that will have the name of one item and how much of that product the restaurant has on-hand in each row. Something along the lines of:  
Product	Amount	Unit

<strong>Customer Interface</strong> <br/>
The customer interface will allow people to place their food orders. The ineterface will appear to be a ordering screen to the customer, but in the background will update current inventory, track sales, and deliver the food order to the restaurant. This should allow for real time tracking of inventory and sales which would be given to our data base to keep up to date information. This interface could be strickly image based, or standard text menu. Not yet decided.
