Project Name: R-Inventory
CS371-Group Project-Restaurant Inventory 
This program will be designed for a food inventory system.
  Systems:
    On hand inventory,
    Expected vs Actual inventory use,
    Customer UI for ordering,
    Data Base to keep track of inventory.
    
    
    
Currently, the main program is run out of the 'Program' Folder, and is run with the 'main.py' file. At the moment, the software will display all the rows from the database -- with the corresponding ids, names, amounts, units, and expiration dates. You can also add items into the database by clicking 'File' in the menubar, and then 'Switch Panels' in order to add rows into the database.

Under the 'File' in the menubar, there is also an option to add items to the database, delete items from the database, and switching to a UI that allows you to order certain items. 

Under the 'Save' Menu, there is an option to save, or 'Post', inventory for the day which saves all the current day's inventory counts. These amounts can be retrieved through another button under the 'File' menu.


To run this program, run the command 'python main.py' under the 'Program' Directory.
